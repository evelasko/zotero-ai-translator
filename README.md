# Zotero AI Translator Suite

A suite of TypeScript packages for AI-powered Zotero translation, built as a monorepo with Turborepo.

## ðŸ“¦ Release Process

This project uses a **tag-based release workflow**. Packages are published to npm only when a version tag is pushed. See [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md) for detailed instructions.

## Packages

### [`zotero-schema-types`](./packages/schema-types)

The foundational package that ingests the official Zotero `schema.json` to generate and export Zod schemas and derived TypeScript types for the entire suite.

### [`zotero-web-client`](./packages/client)

The Zotero API Client - a modern, robust, and type-safe client for the Zotero Web API v3, refactored to consume all its types directly from the `zotero-schema-types` package.

### [`zotero-ai-translator`](./packages/translator)

The AI Translator - translates unstructured content from URLs or raw text into structured, validated Zotero items using AI models via LangChain.
